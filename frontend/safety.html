      1.	 Intro
      <br><br>
      Hello BACC family.  Web3, PFP, NFT, and Crypto space brings us a whole host of investing opportunities, 
      however it also brings with it relentless hackers and scammers keen to rob you of your valuables, 
      without regard and without remorse, sadly, these people would steal from their own grandmother if 
      they could make a buck, they are the lowest of the low, have no issues whatsoever taking whatever 
      they can from the most needy or poor, so don’t think they won’t target you because they will and do.
      <br><br>
      There are several key things you can do to improve your security when buying and selling NFT’s.  Don’t 
      FOMO, don’t jump too quickly when you see something that looks too good to be true, because it is, 
      remember, nothing worth anything is free.  Take the time to follow this guide and it will help you 
      to not get your valuable NFT’s, Crypto and of course your highly valuable BACC NFT’s from being 
      stolen.  There can never be a 100% guarantee, but follow this guide and you’ll greatly reduce the risk.

      2.	Links
      <br>
      The Do’s and Don’ts of Links
      <br><br>
      To Mint NFT projects or buy NFT’s, you will be directed to a web page or a URL link for that specific 
      project’s minting site, or secondary marketplaces like OpenSea or Magic Eden.  Links in Web3 however, 
      can be extremely dangerous.  The problem is that scammers can create fake links that look a lot like 
      the real mint link you are expecting.  These links can trigger a signature or approval transaction 
      that allows them to take Crypto or your NFT’s out of your wallet.  These fake links can also compromise 
      your entire computer and expose your wallets private keys to the scammer so they can take everything 
      out of your wallet.
      <br><br>
      Note that Binance/BscScan has a Token Approval Checker, just provide your public address and see which 
      sites you have approved, and remove any questionable sites, it will cost you a little BSC in gas, but 
      worth it:  Token Approvals | BscScan.  ETH and Polygon/MATIC have their own token approval removals, 
      I have not been able to find one for Solana/Phantom Wallet that I trust, although I have found a 
      Solana token revoke app in GitHub, I need to dig into the code and test it before I can 
      recommend it...  MTF.
      <br><br>
      Because of this, you need to be extremely careful of any link you click on.  Here are some basic 
      rules to follow:
      <br><br>
      <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
        a)	In Discord, turn off “Allow Direct Messages from Server Members” in your privacy settings as 
          this is where a lot of scammers will try to target you with fake mint sites.  Also, be extremely 
          wary of any links to mint sites in Twitter, at first glance they might look legitimate, but 
          they are not… you might see  theboredaapecannabisclub.com (note the ‘aape’, did you see that)? or 
          theboredapecannabisclubofficial.com (a lot of scammers add ‘Official’ to the URL) just like this 
          one did on OpenSea:  Note that our OpenSea 
          link is https://opensea.io/collection/theboredapecannabisclub, an OpenSea clone is 
          using multiple links:  https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-cannabis-club (with dashes) 
          and https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-cannabis-club-2 
          and https://opensea.io/collection/thebored-ape-cannabis-club (thebored, no space)  and of 
          course they are saying they are the Official site, THEY’RE NOT… also note that when you search, 
          the search returns ‘TheBored Ape Cannabis Club’ (no space between The and Bored again) and 
          another copy is using https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-cannabis-club (no ‘the’ and adding 
          the dashes).  If you really pay attention, you begin to see how really creative these scammers 
          can be.<br><br><br>
        b)	Project owners and Admins will NEVER DM you directly and ask you to click on a link to 
          verify your assets or mint a special mint.<br><br><br>
        c)	Projects NEVER have surprise or free mints or discounted mints outside of what has been 
          scheduled (there are a lot of these on Twitter) and announced in the official channels.  If you 
          see something that does not match the official scheduled event, then it is a scam.<br><br><br>
        d)	Only click on links in the #Official-Links or #Announcements channels on Discord.  Never 
          click on links in your DM’s general chat or from Twitter, Instagram or any other social media 
          platforms.<br><br><br>
        e)	Always closely inspect any URL’s that you are about to click on.  If one single character 
          looks off or there are double characters where there shouldn’t be, DO NOT click on it.  It is 
          your responsibility to DYOR on those links to make sure they are valid and match the project links 
          that you are expecting.<br><br><br>
        f)	Most links on social medial platforms like Twitter are highly dangerous.  Scammers will try 
           DM you on something like a competition, early access to mint, free mints or a special 
           giveaway.  It is important to note that almost all of these DM’s and their links are scams.  Do 
           NOT FOMO into these links!<br><br><br>
        g)	Scammers always are watching general chat and will pretend to be someone trusted in the 
          community like an admin and contact you after you ask a question or for help on 
          something.  Remember, never trust anyone reaching out to you in DM’s unless you know exactly 
          what it is about and can verify the person’s identity and were expecting the DM.<br><br><br>
       </p>

      3.	Wallet Setup
      <br><br>
      So you now know what to do and what not to do with links, however there still may be times when you want to click on a link from a new project and mint an NFT you think is legitimate.  Even links from legitimate discord server channels can be scams, so be careful.  Often a whole project can be a scam or “Rug”.  It can be hard to tell sometimes and some seriously legitimate looking sites can still be Rug Pulls.  So, make sure you do a heap of research on a project and who the founders are before minting, do not FOMO!  After you’ve done your research and are ready to mint, this is where wallet setup and security becomes super important.
      To be safe in Crypto you need multiple wallets for different purposes.  If you follow these tips on setting up these wallets this will keep you safe in almost all cases and prevent your valuable NFT’s and Crypto from being stolen:
      <br><br>
      3.1	Wallet Basics:  
      <br><br>
      3.1.1	Hot Wallets and Burner Wallets
      Hot or ‘Burner’ wallets are an effective way of limiting your risks when interacting with untrusted projects or new mints.  Having a burner wallet is 100% essential in terms of setup so you definitely need at least one burner wallet to operate safely the Web3 space.
      <br><br>
      Setting up your ‘Burner’ wallet:
      <br><br>
      <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
        a)	First and always… NEVER give out your wallet Seed Phrase to anyone EVER!!!<br><br><br>
        b)	If you are going to mint from a new project website, particularly one you do not 100% 
          trust, NEVER connect your wallet that contains your valuable NFT’s or Crypto holdings to this 
          site.<br><br><br>
        c)	To mint new projects, create a ‘hot’ or ‘burner’ wallet in MetaMask, Phantom or other 
          wallet of choice. This is a MetaMask (for example) wallet installed on a separate device or in 
          a different web browser and has its own separate Seed Phrase.<br><br><br>
        d)	Example 1: If you have primary MetaMask wallet installed under your Chrome browser, download 
          another web browser like Brave or Firefox and install the MetaMask Extension in that new 
          browser.  Make sure when creating the new ‘burner’ wallet that you set it up as a new wallet 
          with it’s own separate seed phrase.<br><br><br>
        e)	Example 2:  If you have your primary MetaMask wallet working as an app in a phone, install 
          MetaMask on another device like a laptop and set up this ‘burner’ wallet as a new wallet with 
          it’s own separate seed phrase.<br><br><br>
        f)	Do not create this ‘burner’ wallet as an additional account under the same MetaMask used 
          for your primary wallet.  A secondary account on the same MetaMask installation as your primary 
          wallet can be recovered from the same seed phrase used by the primary account.  So, if they hack 
          the wallet in your accounts list, they can get at the others.<br><br><br>
        g)	When minting a new project, always use the burner wallet.  Only put enough ETH (or other 
          Crypto) in this burner wallet for the mint you are doing.  If for some reason the wallet is 
          compromised, then your losses are limited to the small amount of ETH in the wallet.<br><br><br>
       </p>
      <br><br>
      3.1.2	Cold Wallets for Storing Valuables
      Having another wallet or two to store your valuable NFT’s and Crypto is a must.  The best wallets for this are hardware wallets like a ledger or Trezor.  For the points here I will refer to the Ledger, but the Trezor is certainly an alternative.
      <br><br>
      Setting up a ‘Trusted’ wallet or Hardware Wallet:
      <br><br>
      <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
        a)	Hardware wallets story your private keys off of your computer on a physical device and stop 
          hackers from gaining access to these keys if your computer is hacked.  Get at least one Ledger 
          that you can use as a safe place to store your valuables.  A Ledger Nano S Plus is perfect for 
          this.<br><br><br>
        b)	When buying a Ledger, only order from Ledger.com.  Never order a ledger from Amazon or a 
          third party website as these may have been opened and someone else may have the Ledger’s private 
          key already.  Always check that the Ledger you received is still wrapped in plastic and 
          unopened.  When you setup the Ledger for the first time, make sure in Ledger Live that the 
          Ledger wallet passes the Genuine Ledger Check.<br><br><br>
        c)	Once you have setup this wallet, NEVER mint or connect to untrusted Web3 apps or websites 
          from your Ledger/Trezor.  Even though your private keys are stored offline, if you approve a 
          transaction from a fake mint link or bad project, they will still have access to remove valuables 
          from you Ledger.  SO, hardware wallets are not 100% guaranteed from being hacked, they just make 
          it harder for people to get your private keys.  Ultimately, it is up to you to not click on bad 
          links, that is why we have the burner wallet mentioned above.  Any mints and any new or untrusted 
          contract interactions should be done from that burner wallet, not your Ledger.<br><br><br>
        d)	As soon as you mint a NFT that has value, and you are sure it is from a safe project, you 
          should move the NFT from your burner wallet to your trusted/hardware wallet.<br><br><br>
        e)	If you cannot afford a Ledger or Trezor, you should at least setup a new MetaMask wallet 
          as a trusted wallet with it’s own seed phrase.  However, this is not nearly as secure as a 
          hardware wallet, as the private keys for this wallet are stored on your computer.  So, hackers 
          can potentially get your private keys if they can hack your pc or phone.  I Highly recommend 
          getting a Ledger Nano S Plus.<br><br><br>
        f)	Even trusted projects can be compromised, so try to only perform basic fiunctions from your 
          Ledger hardware wallet like selling NFT’s on OpenSea or staking from a trusted project like 
          BACC.  Some people even like to have an ‘Ultra Cold’ hardware wallet that never connects to a 
          smart contract or marketplace.  You can use this ultra-cold wallet to store Crypto or NFT’s you 
          want to hold for long periods of time or are unlikely to sell in the short term.<br><br><br>
        g)	To mitigate any risk, if you have lots of valuable NFT’s and Crypto, it is good to use 
          multiple Ledger wallets and split your assets over several different hardware wallets.  An option 
          is to put Crypto on one wallet and NFT’s on another.  If you have lots of valuable NFT projects, 
          you can even dedicate different Ledger wallets to specific NFT projects, for example, you could 
          have a dedicated Ledger wallet for all of your BACC NFT’s.<br><br><br>

      4.	Password Security Management
      <br><br>
        As some final advice, always make sure your phone computer and wallets like your MetaMask or Phantom auto-lock after a few minutes of inactivity.  Also make sure any passwords on your phone or computer are strong passwords with upper/lowercase combinations including numbers and special characters.  This will make it harder to break into your device or wallet.  If you have trouble remembering all of these passwords like I do, save them in a password manager on your phone or download an encryption password manager like 1Password or BitWarden to save your computer passwords in.  Also, try not to use the same password in multiple locations.

      5.	Final Thoughts
      <br><br>
        This comed from our year's of experience and trial and error, and yes, full disclosure, we have been scammed and rug pulled
        before, live and learn!  I hope this helps people with the basics on how to stay safe in the Web 3 world and allows you to make smart decisions to mint and hold on to your hard-won gains.  Remember, that not taking any action on this is basically like leaving they keys in the car and the doors unlocked, and asking someone to come and try to steal your car.  Education is the key in this space to surviving and thriving in Web3.  If you don’t understand anything in this document, please reach out to one of the admins or knowledgeable members in BACC and ask questions  to make sure you do understand, it is critical to your survival in Web3.  There is no such thing as a bad question, other than the one that goes unasked, and it might just save you making a mistake that costs you everything.
        <br><br>
        All this sounds very grim, because it is, as I said earlier, there are scammers out there with no care about anyone other than themselves, they would cold heartedly steal their grandmother’s last dime without blinking and walk away happy!  Sick as that sounds, it happens, they are out there and they will target you at some point.
